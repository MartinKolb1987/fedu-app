            <h4>What's fedu?</h4>
            <p>
                fedu is a further education webapp. It's for Developers and  Designers, who want to learn something new.<br/> But fedu dont provide tutorial videos, there are plenty of others for this purpouse.<br/>
                Our goal is to provide a webapp where people can watch e.g. in groups and discuss the subject later.<br/>
                Just like your visiting a conference, but without the traveling.

            <h4>The Idea</h4>
            <p>
                The idea for fedu was born by us, three students of Interactive Media in Augbsurg, Germany.<br/>
                Two of us (Martin and Mathias), started fedu as their Bachelor-Thesis in November 2012.<br/>
                Many long weeks of programming and discussing and more programming, we launched fedu in July 2013.
