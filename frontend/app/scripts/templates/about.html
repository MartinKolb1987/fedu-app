    <h4>The Idea</h4>
    <p>
        The idea for fedu was born by us, three students of Interactive Media in Augbsurg, Germany.<br/>
        Two of us (Martin and Mathias), started fedu as their Bachelor-Thesis in November 2012.<br/>
        Many long weeks of programming and discussing and more programming, we launched fedu in July 2013.
